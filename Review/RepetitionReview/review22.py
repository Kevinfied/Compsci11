"""
You won $1,000,000 in the lottery, and you want to take out enough each year to live on.
Ignoring any tax concerns, you invest the money at 9% annual interest.
At the beginning of each year you take out your money.
The amount of money you take out is $50,000 in the first year,
but increases by 12% each year.
Write a program to figure out how many years the money will last,
and how much money you would have in the last year.
