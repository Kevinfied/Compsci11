Setting up matches for a single elimination tournament is fairly straightforward.
All you need to do is randomly assign the first round of games and the rest is all deterministic (there are no more choices to make)
Create a program that allows the user to enter as many names as he or she wants and display the random pairings for the first round.
If there are an odd number of players then add in a player called "Bye" Your program should display the results in a nice neat table.
